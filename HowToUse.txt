This program can be used to train a classification model to classify
    a datasets if supplied with required datasets. It can be used to train a model
    or use a pretrained model to classify an image file.

    Arguments: Are optional and only if user to wants the code to behave a certain
    way. These arguments includes:
        1. The train or predict mode as --mode with default value 'train'
        2. Image Folderc to be used for training, validating and testing
           as --dir with default value 'flowers/'
        3. The folder where you want to save the trained model as --save_dir
           and default value of 'ImageClassifier/'
        4. The CNN model arch to be used for creating the model as --arhc and
           the default value is 'vgg'
        5. The learning rate to be used in the training process as --learning_rate
           with default value is '0.001'
        6. The size of the hidden layer to be used as --hidden_units and
           the default value is '4096'
        7. The number of epochs to be used in the training as --epochs and
           the default value is '5'
        8. The training/prediction to be done using gpu or cpu as --device
           and the default value is 'gpu'
        9. Image path that required for class prediction as --image_path
           and the default is 'flowers/test/1/image_06743.jpg'
       10. The saved model path to be loaded for resuming training or for
           prediction as --checkpoint_path the default is 'Checkpoint/checkpoint.pth'
       11. The file that will be used to convert the labels to meaningful
           flowers name as --category_names with default value as 'label_to_name.json'
       12. The number of top classes to be displayed --top_k with defualt value of '3'


   The program takes user inputs and then process them to execute required action. It will
   either train a model or predict the top classes of an image. To use it do the following:

   1) Change to project folder by typing " cd ImageClassifier" in the terminal
   2) To train a model don't specify mode or use --mode 'train', for example to train
      a vgg16 network, with learning rate of 0.001, hidden layer size of 5000 and using
      the gpu, type the following comand in the terminal " python ImageClassifier.py
      --mode 'train' --arch 'vgg' --learning_rate 0.001 --hidden_units 5000 --device 'gpu' "
   3) To predict the class of an image, change mode to preict and supply the the image path
      For example, to predict the top 3 class of 'flowers/test/1/image_06743.jpg', type the
      following in the terminal " python ImageClassifier.py --mode 'predict' --top_k 3
      --image_path 'flowers/test/1/image_06743.jpg' "
